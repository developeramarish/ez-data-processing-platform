1. tasks progress are managed in "C:\Users\UserC\source\repos\EZ\docs\planning\schema-management-implementation-tracker.md" file  
2. read next task from the file
3. implement the task, read it's details from "C:\Users\UserC\source\repos\EZ\docs\planning\schema-management-gap-analysis-recommendations.md" file and the already implemented codebaseif required use mcp_shrimp_task_manager and other available mcp tools to plan and implement the task, show me task details and ask for approve before implementing.  
4. verify no errors and that evrything defined for the task implemented and works ok, test implementation using browser tool
5. update the progress in "C:\Users\UserC\source\repos\EZ\docs\planning\schema-management-implementation-tracker.md" file
6. update byterover


"C:\Users\UserC\source\repos\EZ\docs\planning\frontend-backend-implementation-plan.md" and "C:\Users\UserC\source\repos\EZ\docs\planning\frontend-backend-implementation-plan-continued.md" defines the implementation order. implemetation guide is based on the front end, the front end should implement it's features completely and backend implemetations at first should be minimal only to support the front end, only then we should implement the plan as it is defined above. use theses documents to update the plan accordinglly and keep in mind that front end should be in the higest priority and only then all the services and infrastructure should be completed. the plan is based on front end implementation.
